# American Community Survey: 1-Year Estimates: Selected Population Profiles 1-Year

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Summary file, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Selected Population Profiles provide an overview of the estimates available across a range of topics for detailed population groups. The data are presented as population counts and percentages. There are over 300 variables in this dataset.
