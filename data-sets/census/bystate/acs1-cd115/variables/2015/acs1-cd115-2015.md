# 2015 American Community Survey 1-Year Data Profile 115th Congressional District

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. The 115th Congressional District Data Profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (at large). Data profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as population counts for over 1,000 distinct variables.
