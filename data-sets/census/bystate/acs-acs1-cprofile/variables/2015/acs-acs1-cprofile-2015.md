# ACS 1-Year Comparison Profiles

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex.  Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more.  Comparison profiles are similar to data profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data.  The current year data are compared with each of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing.  There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset.
