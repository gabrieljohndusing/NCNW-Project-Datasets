# ACS 1-Year Data Profiles

## 2011

<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey designed to provide
communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the
decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type
information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years.
Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about
households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The
American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic
estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds.
The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics.
The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by
the ACS for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,
every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and
places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population,
demographic and housing unit estimates,it is the Census Bureau's Population
Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the
population for the nation, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of
housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census
years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and
housing units.</p>
