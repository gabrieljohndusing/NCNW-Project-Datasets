# ACS 1-Year Comparison Profiles

## 2011

<p>The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data
every year -- giving communities the current information they need to plan
investments and services. The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social,
economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much
of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available
separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex.  Summary files, Subject
tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all
50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district,
every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000
or more.  Comparison profiles are similar to data profiles but also include
comparisons with past-year data.  The current year data are compared with each
of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing. 
There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset.</p>
