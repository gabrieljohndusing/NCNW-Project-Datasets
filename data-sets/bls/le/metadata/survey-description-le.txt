Section 1 (Earnings)

Survey Description:  The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a sample survey of 
the population 16 years of age and over.  The survey is conducted each month by
the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and provides comprehensive
data on the labor force, the employed, and the unemployed, classified by such
characteristics as age, sex, race, family relationship, marital status, occupation,
and industry attachment. The information is collected by trained interviewers
from a sample of about 60,000 households located in 754 sample areas. These areas
are chosen to represent all counties and independent cities in the United States,
with coverage in 50 States and the District of Columbia. The data collected
are based on the activity or status reported for the calendar week including
the 12th of the month.  

Summary Data Available:  Earnings data are available for all workers, with data
available by age, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, sex, occupation, usual
full- or part-time status, educational attainment, and other characteristics.  

Frequency of Observations:  Quarterly averages, not seasonally adjusted.

Annual Averages:  Annual averages are available for all series.  

Data Characteristics:  The earnings data are collected from one-quarter of the
CPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and salary workers. All self-employed
workers are excluded.  Most series pertain to workers who usually work full time
on their sole or primary job.  

Data represent earnings before taxes and other deductions, and include any overtime
pay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job, in the case of multiple
jobholders). Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly (for example, annual,
monthly, hourly) are converted to weekly.  The term "usual" is as perceived by the
respondent. If the respondent asks for a definition of usual, interviewers are 
instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past
4 or 5 months. Data refer to wage and salary workers (excluding all self-employed 
persons regardless of whether their businesses were incorporated).  

Median earnings figures indicate the value that divides the earnings distribution into
two equal parts, one part having values above the median and the other having values
below the median. The medians shown are calculated by linear interpolation of the $50
centered interval within which each median falls. Data expressed in constant dollars
are deflated by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).  

Updating Schedule:  Updates are usually available with the issuance of the quarterly 
usual weekly earnings news release. Annual average data are available in the fourth
quarter news release.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)
